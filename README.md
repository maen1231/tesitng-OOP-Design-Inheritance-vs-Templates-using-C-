I included my raw test data on top of the main.cpp where I tested the results of 1000, 10000, 100k, and 1 million here are the average results
OO test average results:
OO tests for a size of 1000: 3.5
OO tests for a size of 10000: 33.33
OO tests for a size of 100000: 274
OO tests for a size of 1000000:3422
Generic test average results:
Generic tests for a size of 1000: 2.5
Generic tests for a size of 10000: 23.66
Generic tests for a size of 100000: 252.5
Generic tests for a size of 1000000: 3073.33

My conclusion: 
As you can see based on my data pool we have seen generic tests prefom around 10% faster over OO tests which may not seem like much but when speaking for billions of bytes worth of data this 10% could be the difference between days.# tesitng-OOP-Design-Inheritance-vs-Templates-using-C-
